    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to
    China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is
    rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in)
    long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its
    forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to
    meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of
    bamboo and bamboo shoots.<br><br>

    <div class="p3">
    The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000 m
    (9,800 ft). It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and
    uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24
    months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.<br><br>

<div class="p4">
    As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the
    lowland areas where it once lived. The wild population has increased again to 1,864 individuals as of March 2015. Since
    2016, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also classified the giant
    panda as vulnerable. It is a conservation-reliant species. By 2007, the captive population comprised 239 giant pandas in
    China and another 27 outside the country. It has often served as China's national symbol, appeared on Chinese Gold Panda
    coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing.<br><br>

    <h1>Etymology</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p6">
    The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word
    panda has been found.[3] The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of
    the red panda, which is native to Nepal. In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" refers to the red
    panda (Ailurus fulgens),[4] which was described some 40 years earlier and over that period was the only animal known as
    a panda.[5] The binomial name Ailuropoda melanoleuca means black and white (melanoleuca) cat-foot (ailuropoda).[6]
    
    Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear many different names,
    including mò (貘, ancient Chinese name for giant panda),[7] huāxióng (花熊; "spotted bear") and zhúxióng (竹熊; "bamboo
    bear").[8] The most popular names in China today are dàxióngmāo (大熊貓; lit. 'giant bear cat'), or simply xióngmāo (熊貓;
    lit. 'bear cat'). As with the word panda in English, xióngmāo (熊貓) was originally used to describe just the red panda,
    but dàxióngmāo (大熊貓) and xiǎoxióngmāo (小熊猫; lit. 'little bear cat') were coined to differentiate between the species.[8]
    
    In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted dàmāoxióng (大貓熊; lit. 'giant cat bear'), though many
    encyclopedias and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the "bear cat" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in
    this construction, "bear" instead of "cat" is the base noun, making the name more grammatically and logically correct,
    which have led to the popular choice despite official writings.[8] This name did not gain its popularity until 1988,
    when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.
